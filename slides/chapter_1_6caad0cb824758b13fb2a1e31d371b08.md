Welcome Back.
In this lession, we'll learn how to subscribe to datastreams using MQTT.

>> 
MQTT is a publish/subscribe messaging protocol, designed to have a small footprint, making it ideal for IOT usecases.

An MQTT system consists of a client connecting to a server (also called Broker), and this client can then either publish (produce) data to a topic, or subscribe (consume) to data in one or multiple topics.

During this course, we'll only act as a client subscribing to predefined topics, assuming a producer is available and producing data in the topics for us.

Ok, let's dive straight into the code.
>> 
First, we will define the function which is called whenever a new message arrives. 

The function-header used as callback is defined by the paho.mqtt library and needs to have the arguments 
* client, the client instance for this callback
* userdata, the private user data set when creating the instance
* message, an instance of MQTTMessage. This is a class with the properties `topic`, `payload`, `qos`, and `retain`

We're free to select any function name. A reccomended name is "on_message", and we'll stick to that throughout this course.

>>

We'll use the module paho.mqtt, which is maintained under the umbrella of the eclipse foundation, throughout this course.
We'll import the module `paho.mqtt.subscribe` as subscribe.

We're going to use a concept named callback to subscribe to a topic, which is a very efficient way to wait for things to happen on the other end.
A callback calls our function (on_message) whenever a new message is available.

We can now simply use subscribe.callback, with 
* the function to be called as the first argument, 
* the topic to subscribe ("datacamp/roomtemp") as the 2nd argument
* and the server or broker as the third argument

More information and the documentation for the library is available under the projects github page.

>>
Let's put it all together.
First, we import paho.mqtt.suscribe as subscribe.

Then, we define our function print_msg as done on the previous slide,
and then pass this function as the first argument to subscribe.callback, the topic name (datacamp/roomtemp) as second argument, and the hostname for the mqtt server as the 3rd argument.

Once we launch our Script, we'll see the following output.
>>
We see the topic on the left of the colon, as well as the message payload on the right, which is a json object in this case, containing the time, temperature and humidity from an environmental sensor.

In order to stop this script, we'll need to send an interupt or press ctrl+c. We'll see how to fix this in the next lession.

>> 
And now, let's Practice. Enjoy
