## What is a Data stream

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "967040be62"
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
* Constant stream of Data
* Examples {{1}}
  * Twitter messages {{1}}
  * News Articles {{2}}
  * Video streams {{3}}
  * Sensor data (IOT) {{4}}
  * Market orders (financial) {{5}}


`@script`
Data streams are a constant stream of data.
Examples include, but are not limited to
  * Twitter messages
  * News Articles
  * Video streams
  * sensor data or IOT
  * Market orders (financial)

Covering everything in this course would be too much, therefore we'll specifically focus on

`@part1`
* Constant stream of Data
* Examples
  * Twitter messages

  * Video streams
  * **Sensor data (IOT)**
  * Market orders (financial)


`@script`
Sensor data or IOT. 

So let's dive straight in

## MQTT

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "2684c32418"
```

`@part1`
Features: 
* publish / subscribe message protocol
* Small footprint

Server -> Acts as message Broker

Client: 
* connects to a Server (Broker)
* publishes data to a topic
* Subscribes to one or more topics


`@script`
For the purpose of this course, we'll subscribe to Datastreams using MQTT.
MQTT is a publish/subscribe messaging protocol, which is designed to have a small footprint, which makes it ideal for IOT usecases.

An MQTT system consists of a client connecting to one server (also called Broker), and can then either publish (produce) data to a topic, or subscribe to data in one or multiple topic.

During this course, we'll only act as a client subscribing to a Topic, assuming the producer is available and producing data in the predefined topic for us.
